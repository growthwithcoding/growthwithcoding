## 1. Path of the Profile Padawan ⚡ [SUBMITTED]

**Holonet Transmission:** https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184572  
**Mission Status:** Under review by the Product Council  
**Visibility:** Public holofeed (Profile category, Product Feedback)

### Achievement Holocron

  <img src="../assets/ProfilePadawan.png" alt="Profile Padawan badge concept" width="240">
</p>

- **Name:** Profile Padawan ⚡  
- **Theme:** Star‑Wars‑inspired apprentice **trial** for early‑stage profile customization  
- **Target Apprentices:** New and returning developers forging or refreshing their public profile presence

### Padawan Trial – Unlock Conditions

The **Profile Padawan** holocron ignites when an apprentice:

1. Creates a **public** repository named **exactly their GitHub username**, causing GitHub to treat it as the special profile repository  
   - Example: `growthwithcoding/growthwithcoding`
2. Adds a `README.md` file at the root of that repository  
3. Allows that README to manifest as their profile README, which GitHub automatically does when the prerequisites are met

### Why the Council Should Approve This

- Profile READMEs are now used by **millions of developers** to display badges, contribution stats, bios, and external links, making them a central identity artifact on GitHub profiles  
- Profile READMEs have become a primary way for developers to present work, similar to a living holocron of their skills and contributions  
- GitHub already displays a “special repository ✨” hint when this repo is created, but there is no parallel achievement holocron to commemorate the act  
- Other actions already have achievement recognition, such as Pull Shark for merged pull requests and YOLO for merging without review, setting a precedent for behavior‑based badges  
- Rewarding profile customization gives new apprentices a tangible nudge to personalize their presence, likely increasing time spent curating profiles and exploring others

### Badge Visual Lore

- **Visual Direction:** Octocat reimagined as a space‑wizard apprentice, echoing GitHub’s existing space‑themed Octocat art without copying Star Wars directly  

**Icon Prompt for Designers (In‑Universe Briefing):**

> Design an achievement holocron titled “Profile Padawan”. Depict an Octocat‑like mascot in a simple space‑wizard apprentice robe, holding a small glowing **pen** instead of a weapon. In front of them floats a holographic profile slab with generic text lines and an avatar circle, suggesting a GitHub profile README being edited. Use GitHub‑adjacent blues with subtle neon accents, flat modern illustration, high contrast, no text inside the art, and avoid any copyrighted logos or explicit Star Wars elements.

- **Emoji:** ⚡ to evoke the energy‑blade vibe of a nascent Padawan beginning their learning journey

### Council Discussion Prompts

- Which holocron name or icon style would resonate most with the broader Order of developers?  
- Which additional profile‑centered rituals might deserve achievements in future tiers?
  - Pinning repositories that showcase a developer’s best work
  - Completing key identity fields such as bio, location, and website
  - Contributing to organization profile READMEs as part of a guild
  - Tier progression that mirrors apprenticeship → knighthood → mastery (Padawan → Knight → Master)

### Padawan Mission Checklist

- [ ] Monitor the Holonet discussion for feedback, +1s, and lore suggestions  
- [ ] Track upvotes and comment sentiment as signals to the Council  
- [ ] Answer implementation and UX questions from fellow apprentices and mentors  
- [ ] Collect additional profile‑related use cases from the community  
- [ ] Await formal response from the Product Council regarding feasibility and roadmap fit

## 2. Future Holocrons in the Jedi Archive (Parking Lot)

*These concept crystals are not yet transmitted; they rest in the Archive awaiting refinement.*

### Profile Knight ⚔️ – Trials of the Profile

**Concept:** Mid‑tier profile customization **knighthood** for developers who have progressed beyond Padawan status.

**Possible Trials:**

- Complete the **Profile Padawan** holocron first  
- Additionally:
  - Pin 3+ high‑signal repositories that represent meaningful work
  - Fill out bio, location, and website so the profile feels like a complete datapad
  - Contribute to at least one organization profile README, demonstrating service to a guild

---

### Holocron Master 📚 – Keeper of the GitHub Way

**Concept:** Ultimate mastery holocron for legendary keepers of knowledge whose profiles influence a vast network.

**Possible Trials:**

- Complete **Profile Knight**  
- Additionally:
  - Reach 1000+ GitHub followers, indicating strong community gravity
  - Maintain an active contribution streak over a substantial period (e.g., months), showing consistent presence
  - Ensure the profile README helps drive 500+ stars across linked repositories, signaling impact and discoverability

---

### README Guardian 📖 – Sentinel of Documentation

**Concept:** Achievement for developers who treat their profile README as a living codex rather than a static banner.

**Possible Trials:**

- Maintain a profile README with at least 1000+ characters of meaningful content (beyond boilerplate)  
- Integrate badges, stats, or interactive widgets (e.g., contribution graphs, language stats) to enhance discoverability  
- Reach 100+ unique profile README visitors, assuming GitHub tracks profile‑level view metrics in the future

## 4. Using This Holocron

### For Community Engagement on the Holonet

- Reference this saga when replying in the GitHub Community discussion so readers see the full narrative and rationale in one place  
- Use the “Future Holocrons” section to lightly tease Profile Knight and Holocron Master without distracting from the core Padawan proposal  
- Keep track of upvotes, comments, and qualitative sentiment as signals to amplify or refine the pitch

### For Internal Mission Tracking

- Update the **Padawan Mission Checklist** as milestones are reached or new ones appear  
- Append new transmissions (e.g., replies from GitHub staff, merged docs, changelog entries) to the Council Transmission Timeline  
- When a concept graduates from “Parking Lot” to active submission, promote it into its own top‑level section with a dedicated holocron narrative

### For Collaboration with Fellow Jedi and Guilds

- Share this holocron with collaborators who want to understand the full multi‑tier vision for profile achievements  
- Treat this as the single source of truth when expanding into Profile Knight, Holocron Master, or other thematic tiers  
- Link to the GitHub Community discussion from PR descriptions, internal threads, or social posts when you rally support
