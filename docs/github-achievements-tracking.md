# GitHub Achievements Tracking & Initiative Log

**Status:** Public feature request submitted to GitHub Community  
**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026  
**Primary Focus:** Introducing new profile-based achievement badges to encourage developer engagement

---

## 1. Profile Padawan ⚡ [SUBMITTED]

**GitHub Community Discussion:** https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184572  
**Status:** Under Review by Product Team  
**Visibility:** Public (Profile category, Product Feedback)

### Achievement Concept

**Name:** Profile Padawan ⚡  
**Theme:** Star-Wars-inspired apprentice achievement for GitHub profile customization  
**Target Audience:** New & returning developers personalizing their profiles

### Unlock Criteria

The **Profile Padawan** achievement unlocks automatically when a user:

1. Creates a **public** repository named **exactly their GitHub username**
   - Example: `growthwithcoding/growthwithcoding`
2. Adds a `README.md` file in the repository root
3. The README becomes visible as their profile README (automatic when criteria met)

### Rationale

- Profile READMEs are used by **millions of developers** for badges, stats, bios, and links
- They are now a core part of how developers present their work
- GitHub already shows a "special repository ✨" banner, but **no corresponding achievement** exists
- Other actions are rewarded: Pull Shark (merged PRs), YOLO (merged PR without review), etc.
- Rewarding profile customization encourages newer developers to personalize profiles and boost engagement

### Badge Design Concept

**Visual Direction:** Octocat as a space-wizard apprentice (nod to GitHub's 404 Jedi Octocat)

**Icon Prompt for Designers:**
> Create a clean vector achievement badge titled "Profile Padawan". Show an Octocat-like mascot in a simple space-wizard apprentice robe, holding a small glowing pen instead of a weapon. In front of them floats a hologram-style profile card with generic text lines and an avatar circle, suggesting a GitHub profile README being customized. Use GitHub-inspired blues with soft neon accents, flat modern illustration, high contrast, no text inside the art, and no copyrighted logos or exact Star Wars elements.

**Emoji:** ⚡ (energy/lightsaber-inspired, representing the Padawan's learning journey)

### Community Engagement Questions

- What badge name or icon would resonate with the community?
- Are there other profile-centric actions deserving similar achievements?
  - Pinned repositories
  - Completing key profile fields (bio, location, website)
  - Organization profile READMEs
  - Achievement tier progression (Padawan → Knight → Master)

### Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor GitHub discussion for community feedback & engagement
- [ ] Track upvotes and comment sentiment
- [ ] Respond to questions about implementation details
- [ ] Gather additional use cases from community
- [ ] Await GitHub product team review & response
